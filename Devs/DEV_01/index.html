    <p><cite>Feline hyperthyroidism: pretreatment clinical and laboratory evaluation of 131 cases</cite> by: <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Peterson ME, Kintzer PP, and Cavanagh PG stated that <dfn>cats</dfn> water intake may vary.</p>
	
	<q>Animals, like people, typically drink for one reason â€” because they're thirsty.<br />
	On average, cats and dogs alike drink between 10-30 ml per pound per day. <br />
	This amount can be impacted by the amount of moisture in the food, <br />
	and water loss associated with exercise and panting.</q> <br />
